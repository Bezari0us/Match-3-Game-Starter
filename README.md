This is my learning project to make a 3-match-game in Unity from this page https://www.raywenderlich.com/673-how-to-make-a-match-3-game-in-unity 

As for scripting, i create my own scripts by adding "My" before the name of 2 orginal scripts which was already added in the project called "Tile.cs" and "BoardManager.cs". 
By creating my own scripts, i can rewrite the code, comment it to my own will and have the chance to understand further how 3-match-game works. 

 You can start fresh by follow the tutorial on the page above and delete "My" scripts if you like and i also recommend you do that. 
 
 THANKS FOR READING AND GOOD LUCK CODING!
